# todo-express
Simple express ToDo app
The goal of this project is to create a simple app using express.js and mongo DB. Using the free mLabs the app is able to connect to the mLab database and save items and delete them. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Mongo

HTML, CSS were used to build the front end user expirence. Express and mongo to create that interaction to a database.

## Optimizations

For a future feature I would like to add a button to delete all the items, and a way to edit items.
